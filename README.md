- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @JoaoPACastro99, a recent Master's graduate with experience in Business Intelligence, data analysis and data-driven decision making. My thesis was developed in partnership with multinational company Amorim Cork and focused on the application of BI tools to customer data and sales. I have developed strong teamwork, communication, leadership, and analytical skills through academic and extracurricular activities. I am passionate about data and seeking opportunities in data-related jobs and business intelligence. As a curious, independent, and proactive individual, I am eager to apply my skills and experience to new opportunities for personal and professional growth.
